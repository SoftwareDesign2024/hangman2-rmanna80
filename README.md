What is your name? Ryan Manna
How closely did your code follow your diagram? My code followed my diagram losely
If your design decisions changed, why? My designs changed becuase when I was coding I was following the diagram that I had but throughout the process I was missing a few methods or an extra class that would make the orogization/flow of the code better. I also felt that whenever I was coding I had had the logic translated on the paper but I also had to make sure that it connected well within code to run the program.
